Where Is The php.ini Configuration File In CentOS?
Posted by Jarrod on April 5, 2017 Leave a comment (0)Go to comments
How can we find the default configuration files for the PHP packages 
in CentOS Linux?

By using the RPM command we can query a package to find all of its 
associated configuration files. Failing that we can use the find 
command to search the file system for these files, as we will see here.

Finally we’ll cover how we can use a phpinfo file to show us which 
configuration file is in use.


RPM Query Configuration Files
The options we will use with the RPM command are -q to query a package,
 and -c which will list the configuration files that are part of the 
 package. As shown below we have run RPM with the -qc options on the 
 php-common package, which is a dependency when installing the php 
 package and is where the php.ini file comes from in CentOS.

[root@centos7 ~]# rpm -qc php-common
/etc/php.d/curl.ini
/etc/php.d/fileinfo.ini
/etc/php.d/json.ini
/etc/php.d/phar.ini
/etc/php.d/zip.ini
/etc/php.ini
These are all of the default configuration files that are installed 
by the php-common package, we can see here that by default the php.ini 
file is found at /etc/php.ini.

There are also a couple more configuration files from the php package.

[root@centos7 ~]# rpm -qc php
/etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf
/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/10-php.conf
The php package requires the httpd package to be installed, 
which makes sense as these are the configuration files that tell 
Apache how to work with PHP.

Find Command
If you aren’t using packages to install PHP and perhaps compiled it
 from source instead or otherwise installed to a custom location, 
 we can easily run find over the entire file system to find these files.

[root@centos7 ~]# find / -name php.ini
/etc/php.ini
The above example will search through root file system ‘/’ and find 
every file named ‘php.ini’.

PHPInfo
We can create a simple phpinfo file and open it in a browser to display 
the location of the php.ini file that is being used. Copy the below into
 a .php file and navigate to it within a browser to view this 
 information. You should delete the file once you’re done, as this 
 can provide a lot of information to an attacker.

<?php
phpinfo();
?>
The “Configuration File (php.ini) Path” shows the directory the 
php.ini file can be found in, while “Loaded Configuration File” 
shows the full path to the file.
